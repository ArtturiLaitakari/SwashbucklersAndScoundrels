Tässä seikkailun aihiossa on poliittinen kriisi, kasvava kaaos ja muinainen uhka, joten pelinjohtajan kannattaa määritellä paikat, jotka liittyvät vallanvaihtoon, kauppareittien turvattomuuteen ja muinaiseen linnoitukseen.



## Daggerfordin kaupunki (Pääsijainti)

- Miten kaupunki on muuttunut?

- Kuka on ottanut vallan? (Paikallinen lordi, salaperäinen neuvosto, palkkasoturit, kultti?)

- Mitä duken kuolemasta kerrotaan virallisesti, ja mitkä ovat huhut?

- Miten kansa suhtautuu uuteen hallitsijaan? (Kapinoiko joku?)


## Tärkeitä paikkoja Daggerfordissa:

- Daggerfordin linna: Kuka asuu siellä nyt? Kuinka hyvin se on puolustettu?

- Paikallinen kirkko/katedraali: Voiko sieltä saada tukea tai tietoa?

- Kiltatalot: Onko kauppiaat jakautuneet vanhaa ja uutta hallitsijaa kannattaviin ryhmiin?

- Kapakat ja mustan pörssin alueet: Mitä huhuja liikkuu ja voiko sieltä värvätä apua?



## Kauppareitti (The Trade Way) ja Bandit-leirit

- Miksi rosvojoukot liikkuvat vapaasti?

- Ovatko ne vain opportunisteja vai osa suurempaa salaliittoa?

- Onko heillä joku johtaja, jolla on suurempi päämäärä?

- Mitkä kaupungit kärsivät eniten (Waterdeep? Baldur’s Gate?)


**Tärkeitä paikkoja reitin varrella:**
- Hylätty vartiotorni tai majatalo: Entinen suojapaikka, nyt ehkä rosvojen tukikohta.

- Maantierosvojen tukikohta: Onko se metsässä, luolissa vai jopa maagisesti piilotettu?

- Kadonneet karavaanit: Jättävätkö ne taakseen merkkejä siitä, että hyökkääjät eivät ole normaaleja rosvoja?


## Muinainen linnoitus – Dragonspear Castle (tai vaihtoehtoinen rauniopaikka)

- Mitä linnassa todella tapahtuu?

- Onko portti Helvettiin aktivoitumassa uudelleen?

- Onko uusi Daggerfordin hallitsija yhteydessä linnan tapahtumiin?

- Onko linnan alla kadonnut artefakti, joka houkuttelee olentoja pimeyden ulottuvuuksista?


## Tärkeitä paikkoja linnassa:

- Linnan piha: Onko siellä uusia asukkaita (palkkasotureita, hirviöitä, kultisteja)?

- Kellaritasot: Onko vanhat kryptat tai helvettiportti yhä aktiivisia?

- Muinaiset kirjastot tai rituaalisalit: Voivatko pelaajat löytää täältä vihjeitä siitä, mitä on tapahtumassa?



## Mysteerien selvittämiseen liittyvät paikat

- Salaiset kokoontumispaikat: Missä muutosvastaiset aateliset, kapinalliset tai mystikot kokoontuvat?

- Hylätty kartano tai piilotettu temppeli: Voisiko tämä olla paikka, josta löytyy tietoa muinaisesta pimeydestä?

- Vanhat Daggerfordin katakombit: Voisiko täällä olla vihjeitä menneistä tapahtumista tai kadonneesta aarteesta?



### Seikkailun rakenteeseen liittyviä kysymyksiä pelinjohtajalle

✔️ Mikä on todellinen juoni? – Onko Daggerfordin valtataistelu vain harhautus ja todellinen vaara tulee linnasta? Vai onko uudella hallitsijalla omat demoniset tai nekromanttiset suunnitelmansa?

✔️ Miten kaupunki reagoi? – Ovatko asukkaat peloissaan, kapinassa vai valmiita neuvottelemaan?

✔️ Mitkä ovat pelaajien valinnat? – Voivatko he vaikuttaa siihen, kuka hallitsee Daggerfordia? Pitäisikö heidän yrittää sulkea Helvetin portti?



Pelaajien tärkeimmät paikat ovat 
- Daggerford (vallankaappaus ja politiikka), 
- Trade Way (rosvot ja kadonneet karavaanit) ja 
- muinainen linnoitus (kasvava yliluonnollinen uhka). 

Tehtävät
- Mouse, linnan tutkinta, vastustajien eliminointi
- Slaine ja Samira, kiltojen käännyttäminen, muiden tuki
- Selene, salaiset kokoontumispaikat
- Martin, trade routes
- Melisandra, salainen linna.

# Intro: Daggerford Has Fallen

Maelwyn hurried the Old Master, Delfe, toward the hidden stairs that would lead them out of the castle. The Duke had fallen, with Aseansea and Frederick at his side. The Red Wizards of Thay had marched into the city, overwhelming the defenses with ease. Many suspected treachery, as the gates had never been closed.

Delfe cast an illusion over the ruined chamber, making it appear completely destroyed.

They sealed the hidden door just in time and rushed to the ruins of Harpshare Castle, where the wizard called for aid.

The next day, a representative from Waterdeep announced that a new Duke and his retinue were on their way to drive out the Red Wizards. Delfe was shocked but swore to aid the new Duke in restoring peace.

Later that same day, a hawk soared into the hideout and transformed into an incredibly beautiful tiefling. She introduced herself as Noctessa, a druid and a war hero. She reported that she had seen an army marching toward them. Lewellyn sounded the alarm, and the castle prepared for battle.

Noctessa requested the aid of an archer, and a teenage boy volunteered. Together, they set out to intercept the approaching force.

Outside the castle, Noctessa cast Haste on herself and the boy, and they sprinted 100 meters before spotting the enemy force.

The group was led by a bald, tattooed human mage in a crimson robe, commanding ten warriors clad in black.

### Round 1

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/e/e2/Doric.png/revision/latest?cb=20230411154704&path-prefix=protagonist" alt="Druid" width="300">  "Quick, hide in the forest!" Noctessa commanded, summoning a thick mist to obscure them.

> Mana used: Wild Shape, Haste, Haste, Call Mist = 4/16

Noctessa continued casting, summoning sharp roots and thorns from the ground, spreading them across the road.

> Mana used: 5/16

She slipped into the forest beside the boy and spoke softly.

"Your job is to lure as many warriors into the trees as possible. Remember, you're fast. Run, shoot, and run again. If they give up the chase, follow them and shoot from a distance. I'll see if I can reach the mage or if I need to deal with the soldiers first."

The boy looked at her with determination. "Don't worry, I'll protect you."

Noctessa studied him for a moment, covering her mouth to stifle a laugh. After a brief pause, she nodded respectfully to him.

"Are you ready?" she whispered.

The boy loosed an arrow and shouted, "Die, dogs!" His shot struck one of the warriors.

> Roll: 19 + 5 = 24
> Damage: 5
> Effect: The warrior suffers Exhaustion ( from half hit point).

The soldiers raised their shields and spread out along the forest’s edge.

"Destroy them! No mercy!" the mage roared, casting protective spells upon himself.

> Spells cast: Arcane Shield & Arcane Armor
> Mana used by red wizard: 2/9

Round 2

The soldiers formed a line and steadily advanced into the forest. The wounded warrior moved in front of the mage, peering cautiously from behind his shield.

The mage cast Magic Missile, sending a bolt of force streaking toward the boy. It slashed across his back, leaving a deep wound despite his valiant attempt to dodge. He glanced toward Noctessa, who motioned for him to flee. Without hesitation, the boy turned and ran.

> Mage casts Magic Missile:
Hit: 24 vs. AC 15
Damage: 2+1-1 = 2
Remaining HP: 11 (Flesh wound)



The soldiers, now more confident, pursued him while scanning their surroundings. Though the boy's magically enhanced speed was more than double theirs, they believed they could tire him out eventually.

Meanwhile, Noctessa crept toward the road’s edge and cast Spirit Weapon. The mage sneered at her in disdain and unleashed another Magic Missile.

> Mage attacks: 23 (hit)
Damage: 2 → Armor absorbs it
Spirit Weapon cast → Mana: 6/16


Noctessa seized Selûne's spear, a weapon of pure moonlight, and sprinted toward a soldier.

> Move 30 ft. → Easily reaches target

### Round 3

Noctessa hurled her spear, aiming for the exhausted soldier. Weakened and sluggish, he attempted to block with his shield.

> Soldier is weakened → Noctessa has advantage
> Roll: 18 + 15 = 33
> Damage: 7 + 1 = 8

The spear pierced through his stomach, shattering his spine. The soldier collapsed into a pool of his own blood.

The mage turned pale as he realized who stood before him.

"Noctessa… I’ve waited a long time for the chance to drink ale from your ugly skull, horned one."

Noctessa called her radiant spear, but before she could strike, the mage conjured a wall of fire between them. She leaped backward to avoid being reduced to ashes.

For a moment, the druid and the mage locked eyes. Noctessa steadied her stance and...


### Round 4

With a sharp command, Noctessa directed her spectral spear to pierce through the flames. It emerged unscathed and struck the mage’s shield.

> Roll: 20 → Mage suffers "Dazed" (Disadvantage on Dexterity-based actions)
> Roll: 20 + 15 = 35 vs. Mage’s block: 16 + 3 = 19
> Damage: 4 + 1 = 5 - 2 (shield) = 3
> Mage HP: 11 remaining

The mage, now visibly shaken, began chanting frantically. A fireball materialized between his hands, growing larger as he spread his arms. With a thrust, he hurled it toward Noctessa.

Her eyes widened as the blazing sphere rushed toward her. With a swift motion, she threw herself backward into a tactical roll, arms outstretched to disperse the impact.

> Roll: 14 + 5 = 20 vs. DC 18
> Success x2 → Armor absorbs the damage
> Move: 15 ft. back → Mana: 3/9

As she rose, Noctessa found herself face-to-face with three soldiers. She grinned and waved at them.

Then, with effortless grace, she flipped backward three times, slipping out of their reach.

> Evasion check: 20 → Noctessa escapes combat range

### Round 5

Beyond the wall of fire, standing beside the mage, a beautiful tiefling smiled. The mage grimaced stiffly. He carefully waved his hand, and black darkness enveloped him.

Within the void, Noctessa dropped to all fours, her moonlit spear fading away. She whispered, "Selûne, grant me the strength of the Bear." Her body expanded, limbs growing thick with muscle, fur sprouting across her form. Now a massive black bear, she immediately scented the mage’s movement and pursued him into the woods.

The mage turned and screamed in terror.

> Mage casts Darkness.
Noctessa uses Wild Shape → Black Bear.
Mana: 4/9 | Mage’s Mana: 7/16

The bear lunged at the mage, but he barely managed to block with his shield.

> Attack: 6 + 13 = 19 vs. AC 16 → 1 success
Damage: 1 + 1 = 2 → Arcane Armor absorbs it

The soldiers, searching around the darkness for the druid, failed to realize where she had gone—or who she had become.


### Round 6

The bear grabbed the mage, its massive claws digging into his robes.

> Attack: 4 + 13 = 17 vs. AC 16 → Hit Mage is now Grappled

The mage gritted his teeth and focused, pushing through the pain.

> Concentration check: 6 + 4 = 10 → Succeeds
Mage casts Sphere of Force → Bear is flung backward

A shimmering force field surrounded the mage, repelling Noctessa. She shook her massive head, turned, and lunged at an approaching soldier.

> Attack: 10 + 13 = 23 vs. defense 16
Mana: 5/9
Bear shreds the soldier’s armor → 2 damage

Blood trickled down the soldier’s side, but he remained standing, his face set in grim determination.

> Two soldiers attack:
Hits: 19 and 23 → 6 + 7 = 13 damage hp 3/20

The bear roared in pain, momentarily dazed, her movements slowing.

> Noctessa is Dazed → Movement reduced to normal speed

The mage laughed from within his protective bubble.

Meanwhile, the archer boy, standing on the road some twenty meters away, fired an arrow into a soldier’s back.

> Attack: 16 + 5 = 21
Damage: 5 - 2 (armor) = 3

The wounded soldier turned, startled, raising his shield as he charged toward the boy.

### Round 7

The bloodied bear lunged for the soldier’s head, but he quickly raised his shield. Noctessa’s jaws clamped down on his shoulder instead.

> Attack: 17 + 13 = 30 vs. AC 16 → 3 successes
Claw damage: 2 → Armor absorbs 2 → Total damage: 3
Soldier HP: 8/13

The second soldier slashed at her side, but the bear twisted unnaturally fast, dodging away.

> Attack: 14 + 5 vs. Def 15 → 1 success
Damage: 3
HP: 4 → Exhausted

The mage grinned triumphantly, dismissing his barrier and inhaling the fresh air.
The archer boy took aim at the mage, loosed an arrow, then immediately turned to flee.

> Advantage (Mage wasn’t expecting the shot): Rolls 8 and 10 → 15 vs. def 14
Hit! Damage: 1 + 2 - 2 (armor) = 1
Mage HP: 10

> The boy sprinted away, covering 13 × 2 = 26 meters.

The soldier chased after him, running full speed.

> Sprint: 2 × 8 = 16 meters
Athletics check (disadvantage): Roll 4 → 1 success
Total distance: 17 meters (Still behind the boy)

Realizing he couldn't catch him, the soldier slowed.

The mage’s eyes glowed red as he cast Scorching Ray. A searing red beam shot from his eyes, striking the bear.

> Attack: 11 + 5 vs. def 15 → Hit
Damage: 1 + 1 = 2
HP: 1/20

The bear shrank down, fur vanishing, as Noctessa returned to her tiefling form. The wounds disappeared, leaving her completely unharmed.
The mage cursed.
Only now did he remember—a druid’s animal form takes the damage, but their true body remains unscathed.

### Round 8

Side by side, two warriors marched toward the druid with their shields raised. Noctessa spread her arms and called upon Selune’s power, summoning a glowing moonbeam spear into her hand.

> Casting defense, mana 7/16, warriors +5 advantage for two attackers. Roll 17+5 vs. 25, Noctessa blocks both attacks.

Noctessa blocked the first strike with the light between her hands and threw her spear in front of the second warrior’s sword, deflecting it. She then commanded the spear to strike the first warrior.

> 8+15 vs. 16 = 2 successes, 2 damage through armor. HP 5 remaining, exhausted, strength-based rolls penalized.

The wizard decided it was time to continue his mission and ran toward the castle. Milesandra shouted to the bowboy, “Catch the wizard!” The boy hesitated, looked around, then ran into the forest.

Noctessa felt herself growing tired. She might not be able to maintain all of her spells for much longer. The warriors spoke up, “Hey, we’re just doing our jobs. How about we call this a good fight and all go our separate ways? We’ll find more peaceful work up north.”

Noctessa shook her head. “You made a pact with devils and knowingly chose to serve an evil organization. The sentence is death.”
With a desperate cry, the warriors charged at her in a reckless attack.
At the forest’s edge, six more warriors emerged. The druid cursed under her breath.

### Round 9

The warriors struck, one limping and bleeding, the other full of defiance.

> 14+5 + 5 vs. 25, Noctessa blocks both attacks.

Noctessa retreated, spinning her spear between them, preventing them from reaching her. She pulled her hand back and thrust forward, sending the glowing weapon into the wounded warrior’s stomach.

> Roll 12 + 15 vs. 16 = 3 successes, 4 damage minus 2 armor. HP 3, dazed and dizzy.

Noctessa noticed a pikeman behind her.
The wizard reached the castle gates, and Lewellyn looked down from the tower, worried.

### Round 10

Noctessa vanished into a misty cloud, leaving the warriors confused. Ten meters away, in the forest, she crept up to the archer, stopping him from shooting an arrow.

“Wait, he’s still dangerous.”

The boy was beginning to understand just how powerful Noctessa was—despite being a woman.
The warriors formed a line behind the wizard.

“Open the gates, surrender! Slavery is better than brutal death,” the wizard shouted.

Noctessa sat down and lay back on the ground. “Is there a hidden door?”
The boy shook his head. “I don’t know, we just arrived.”

“If those defenders don’t hide, the wizard will burn them. I need to warn them. Stay hidden.”
Noctessa transformed into an eagle and flew to the wall.

> Mana 8/16.

### Round 11

The red wizard spotted Lewellyn and cast a laser-like gaze. The man dodged at the last second, but part of his hair burned.

> Roll 7+9=16, mana 6/9, Lewellyn def 19, dodges.

Frustrated, the wizard cursed, walked up to the large, iron-reinforced door, and cast a spell. Flames gushed from his palm, blackening the wood.

> 7+9=16, 3 damage -2, HP 5/6, mana 7/9.

Lewellyn shouted to his men, “He’s burning the gate, prepare to fight to the last!”

Milesandra smirked. “Don’t be so hasty. I have one more trick up my sleeve.”

She prayed to the moon for rain and storm, and the sky darkened. Black clouds gathered over the castle, and rain began to fall as the wind howled.

“Great! Will that put out the fire?” Lewellyn shouted, but the druid leaned over the wall and commanded the sky to strike the red wizard.

“Strike down nature’s enemy!” she cried, and lightning flashed.

> Lightning vs. wizard, 17+15=32 vs. 18. The red wizard tried to shield himself but failed. 3 successes, +2 damage, armor -2. HP 7/10.

### Round 12

“Sir, we must retreat! They have the upper hand,” a warrior pleaded.

The wizard panted, pale, and shoved him aside. “NO! I will not lose to a tree-hugger!”

He raised his hands, channeling his fury into a spell, shouting, “I can do that too!”

> Roll 1, critical failure.

Lightning shot from the wizard’s hands, but the raindrops pulled the electricity back to the ground, forming a deadly carpet that struck everyone in the area.

> Random roll 11, deals 3 damage to all, bypasses armor. Wizard mana 8/9.

One warrior collapsed unconscious. The wizard’s robe caught fire, and he flailed, burning, before falling unconscious in the mud, where the rain slowly extinguished his charred body. The remaining wounded warriors fled in panic, chased by a few stray lightning bolts—some didn’t survive.

Finally, the druid collapsed on her back, watching the clouds disperse.

“That was… extremely exhausting.”

“Incredible! I’ve never seen such a powerful sorceress. You’re a one-woman army!” Lewellyn exclaimed.

“You should see Selune… She’s the real…” And Noctessa passed out.
