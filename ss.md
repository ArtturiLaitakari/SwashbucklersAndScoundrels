# Wildshape

This stunt lets you assume the form of any natural animal. When you’re in your wild shape, your weapons and armor meld into your new form, meaning you can’t use them. Your new form lasts for the rest of the scene or until you dismiss it with a mental command.  

Choose one of the forms below. When an entry tells you that your skills change, they change only for the purposes of rolling them; 
You gain the hitpoints of the new form. 
No matter what form you assume, your **Instincts** sometimes get in the way—though they can be helpful too.  
If your hitpoints fall to zero in wild shape, excess damage falls to your own form and you revert back to humanform immediately.
Your wildshape has to heal like you do, so you have to give it time to heal or ask a healer to heal while you are in that shape.
You cannot heal yourself as you cannot cast spells in a wildshape.
On the plus side, each animal has their own hitpoints.

# Combat

### Duel rules
Enemy and player roll dice and compare results.

### basic NPC fights
Enemies have DC for their Attacks and Defences.
Either precalculated on monster manual, or calculated by DM at the start of the fight.

Attack DC = Stat + skill +10
Defence DC = Stat + skill +10

Player rolls against defence DC, if he gets over DC, he gets a success for every 5p or a fraction of.
Same for defending against an attack. If he fails, he gets damage for every 5p or a fraction of plus damage bonus, minus his armor.

## initiative: 
Combat is measured in 10second rounds, during which each side has an opportunity to act. Decide which side acts first by making a Initiative vs. Initiative check between the sides’ leaders. 
When a side acts, all its creatures, in clockwose order, may move  and or take one other action such as attacking, casting a spell, moving, maneuvering, etc.

## ranged attacks: 
Ranged attacks cannot be made while in melee. If the target is in melee, the attack takes a -5 penalty.

## modifiers:
 Attack and maneuver checks may gain +5 or -5 modifiers based on positioning, ganging up, weapon types, aiming, visibility, cover, foe size, range, surprise, elevation, etc. 
##  turns:
  While dungeon delving, time is tracked in 10-minute segments called turns. Most actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take up one turn.
  
## crawling speed: 
40mper turn. PCs spend most of this time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. At this speed, the PCs automatically detect traps and map their environment.

## walking speed: 
800m per turn. PCs are surprised by all encounters and spring all traps, but may still map the dungeon. Walking speed is usually used when backtracking through areas the party has already explored. 

## running speed: 
1600m per turn. PCs are surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. Candles are blown out. 

Running speed is typically used as a last resort, usually when the party is fleeing for their lives.

### WHEN YOU REACH 0 HP
 As you take damage in the bone-crunching worlds of ICRPG, you’ll eventually f ind yourself at 0. At that instant, your character drops unconscious. All SPELLS or effects you were creating vanish, and you’re bleeding out fast. The clock is t icking on your life. 
###  ROLL FOR DYING!
  On your NEXT TURN after you drop to 0 HP, roll a D20. Pray you roll high, because in success number of ROUNDS, without help or a MIRACLE, your character will die with a capital D.
  
###     IT’S A MIRACLE! 
    On each of your TURNS while you’re DYING, you get a very narrow chance to miraculously regain consciousness. Roll a D20. If it’s a natural 20, some miracle of anatomy has brought you back awake with 1 HP. It’s a MIRACLE!
    
##  3 kinds of turns

### ACTION ONLY: 
Sometimes, you’re exactly where you want to be and staying put for this TURN. You might... 
• Attack an enemy with a weapon 
• Take a closer look at encoded glyphs or symbols 
• Call upon magic power to cast a SPELL 

### MOVE NEAR + ACTION: 
Usually, you’ll need to move just a bit to get where you’re needed, then make a roll to do something. You might... 
• Dash down a corridor and smash a hole in the wall 
• Hurry to a friend and heal her injuries 
• Move through a battlefield to block incoming arrows 
• move your move number in meters

### MOVE FAR: 
Use your entire TURN just to move twice as far as normal. If you just need to move as far as you can, you might... 
• Sprint down a dusty street to escape an explosion 
• Dash and slide under a slowly-closing stone doorway
• move your move number in meters tiimes 2 plus athletics successess
