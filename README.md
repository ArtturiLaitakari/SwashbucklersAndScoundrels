# Chapter One: Base rules
The  idea of S&S is to produce D&D experince with fater modern system that fixes oddities of that traditional system.
Base idea is roll D20, add your skill, compare against opposing difficulty.
Attack versus defense is Your skill versus his skill, adding D20 to both, and compare difference. Higher number wins.

### Difficulty Classes (DC)

The Difficulty Class (DC) determines how hard it is to accomplish a task.
The player must roll a d20 and add the appropriate skill andmodifiers to meet or exceed the DC.
Natural 1 always fails, and natural 20 always succeeds and gives a bonus effect. In combat it's extra bebefit for the roller.

### General Difficulty Levels

| DC  | Difficulty       | Successes | Description |
|-----|----------------|------------|-------------| 
| 5   | Very Easy      | 1          | Almost impossible to fail |
| 10  | Easy          | 2          | A basic task that most can do |
| 15  | Moderate      | 3          | Requires skill or luck |
| 20  | Hard          | 4          | Challenging even for skilled characters |
| 25  | Very Hard     | 5          | Exceptionally difficult |
| 30  | Nearly Impossible | 6       | Only masters can succeed |

Successess are basically compared in effects. 4 successess against 3 successess is 1 success and in attack means base damage of 1 plus weapon damage.

#### Example

Gaston "the mouse" has light weapon defense 26, so it is VERY HARD to hit him, as long as he can block. Naturally, that is only for the first block, second attack difficulty is only 21, third is 16 and fourth is 11th. More than 4 attacks rarely can be done.

#### Optional duel rules

Archmage Selene casts magic missile against Martin the cleric of Tempus.
* Selene rolls 16, add her skill 17 plus  1 from her staff of Magius = 34. Martin rolls 9 plus 15 skill plus +2 his shield = 24.
* Selene wins by 8, success 2, so her base damage is 2, and MM damage is +1 total of 3.
* Because Martin has Full Plate Mail, his armor rating is 3, blocking the whole attack.

So unlike in D&D, no need for massive amounts of HP to describe how high level characters can take beating, they block.


### Advantage and Disadvantage

When character has an advantage, he rolls 2 D20 and chooses the better.
When character has a disadvantage, he rolls 2 D20 and chooses the worse.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation
### Classes
In washbucklert and Scoundrels there are 4 main classes, you customise your character's class by combining these classess to get the combination you need.
* Fighter
* Rogue
* Magician
* Warlock

Warlock is a person who makes a bargain with a higher power and in return he gets magical power. He is limited by his vow, he lives to push his patron's agenda.
* Can access to CHA based warlock spells
* Has a new perk called Indebted, that is added to his perks, starts with one checkbox and he gets a new checkbox to his other perks, usually to status.

Magician is  person who find he has an inborn ability to cast magic, he goes through long and rigorous training to channel magical energies.
* Casting arcane magic is flashy, requires loud incantatios and hand signals, casting with 1 hand mage eiher casts a cantrip or with disadvantage.

Fighter is a person strong, he learns how to fight.

Rogue is a dexterious person, he learns to fight, and all the skill an adventurer needs.

### Stats

| Level | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Poor ability                                                 |
| 2     | Average human.                                               |
| 3     | Peak performance - The best an average human can achieve     |
| 4     | Exceptional human - A skill level expected from a professional |
| 5     | World record - What the best people in a given field could achieve |
| 6     | Improbable achievements - Physically possible feats that would be unimaginable for most people |
| 7     | Highly improbable achievements - Almost physically impossible, but still something a human could potentially achieve at some point |

#### Strength
Strength rates your raw muscle power. Athletic endeavors like climbing, jumping, and sprinting are usually governed by strength. Attacks made with melee weapons are often resolved with the Strength skill. Hired muscle, soldiers, athletes, laborers, and guards usually have high Strength.
#### Dexterity
Dexterity describes how quick, agile, and graceful you are. Sneaking through a quiet street in the dead of night, quick-drawing your sword and keeping your balance while on a rain-slick fourth story ledge are related to Dexterity. Shooting ranged weapons and dodging physical attacks are usually done using Dexterity. Pickpockets, sailors, acrobats, and many thieves have high Dexterity.
#### Intelligence
Intelligence reflects your reasoning, logical ability, memory, and academic knowledge. Deciphering a secret code, scouring a library for information, and detecting a forged document are governed by Intelligence. Intelligence is usually the basis of defending against mental and social attacks. Scholars, mages, merchants, and skilled thieves frequently have high intelligence.
Your magical power is determined by your Intelligence.
#### Charisma 
Charisma measures your force of personality, your ability to impose your will upon the people and environment around you. Fast talking a merchant, rallying a frightened crew, and casting a spell are things Charisma will help you with; mental attacks, magical or mundane, are generally based on Charisma. Con artists, elected officials, powerful wizards, and ship captains often have high Charisma.
Your warlock power is determined by your Charisma.


### Skills
Fighters and rogues get 6 skill points per level to use, Magicians and warlocks get 4. Skills must be bought in a pyramid, so if you have a skill at level 3, you need one or more skill at level 2 and one or more skills a level 1.
Math on the table below.

| Points | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | 11th |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| 66     | 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2    | 1    |
| 55     | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1    |      |
| 45     | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |      |      |
| 36     | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |      |      |
| 28     | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |      |      |
| 21     | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |      |      |
| 15     | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |     |      |      |
| 10     | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |     |     |      |      |
| 6      | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |     |     |     |      |      |
| 3      | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |      |      |

Left over points you have like if you have 24 points, and row is 21 points, you have 3 points over, that means you have extra skill at level 3.

Also [Unocmmon spells](Uncommon-spell.md)

# Wildshape

This stunt lets you assume the form of any natural animal. When you’re in your wild shape, your weapons and armor meld into your new form, meaning you can’t use them. Your new form lasts for the rest of the scene or until you dismiss it with a mental command.  

Choose one of the forms below. When an entry tells you that your skills change, they change only for the purposes of rolling them; 
You gain the hitpoints of the new form. 
No matter what form you assume, your **Instincts** sometimes get in the way—though they can be helpful too.  
If your hitpoints fall to zero in wild shape, excess damage falls to your own form and you revert back to humanform immediately.
Your wildshape has to heal like you do, so you have to give it time to heal or ask a healer to heal while you are in that shape.
You cannot heal yourself as you cannot cast spells in a wildshape.
On the plus side, each animal has their own hitpoints.

# Chapter three: other details

### Taint: Corruption & Madness 

Every scene a corrupting spell is cast, mark one corruption point. (yes, no matter how many times in a scene you cast a corrupting spell).

You need to do good deeds to reduce corruption.

| Corruption | Visibility, warping of vision |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1          | Mediocre                      |
| 2          | Average                       |
| 3          | Fair                          |
| 4          | Good                          |
| 5          | Great                         |

## Combat

Attacker roll their skill (stat+skill) versus defence in order to hit.

### Defence 

- Dodge: athletic skill +10
- Brawling block: skill +10. unarmed only
- Weapon block: skill +10, melee only
- Shield block: weapon skill + 10 + shield bonus.
- Mage block: Thaumaturgy + 10 + spell benefit, if suitable spell used.
- Warlock block: Pact magic + 10 + spell benefits, if suitable spell used.
- Will power (Passive defence): pact magic or Thaumaturgy +5.

## Weapons

In combat you test your skill of your attack versus the enemys defence skill. Every success divided by 5 grants 1 damage.

Your weapon bonus adds damage to that number, and target's armor reduces damage by it's rating.

### Success

| Roll total over enemy | Base damage |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 - 5                 | 1           |
| 6 - 10                | 2           |
| 11 - 15               | 3           |
| 16 - 20               | 4           |
| 21 - 25               | 5           |
| 26 - 30               | 6           |
| 31 - 35               | 7           |
| 36 - 40               | 8           |

Unarmed, base damage plus 0. 

### Light Weapons

Light weapons, like rapiers, scimitars, nunchucku, daggers, and so forth, rely more on speed and
precision than on strength. Naval cutlasses sometimes count as finesse weapons, depending on
the style of swordplay the wielder’s using. When you use a light weapon, you  use Dexterity
instead of Strength for any rolls you make with it, and use light weapons skill.
Damage with light weapons is base damage plus 1. 
Even 2 handed light weapons have dmg +1, but have much better reach.

### Martial Weapons

Martial weapons are weapons that rely on main strength, training, or both. Longswords, battle
axes, clubs, and warhammers are all martial weapons. Clubbing a guy upside the head with a
pistol or rifle counts as a martial weapon, but it sure won’t do its reliability any favors. When you
successfully attack with a martial weapon, you deal 2 additional point of damage.

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons are like martial weapons but bigger; they are weapons of brute force and
overwhelming power. Great swords, mauls, cabers, and other huge weapons are heavy weapons.
When you attack with a heavy weapon, you deal 3 additional points of damage above base damage. 
However, while you wield it, you have disadvantage on initiative.

## ranged attacks: 
Ranged attacks, mundane or magic, cannot be made while in melee. If the target is in melee, the attack takes a -5 penalty.

## initiative: 
Combat is measured in 10second rounds, during which each side has an opportunity to act. Decide which side acts first by making a Initiative vs. Initiative check between the sides’ fastest persn. 
When a side acts, all its creatures, in clockwose order, may move  and or take one other action such as attacking, casting a spell, moving, maneuvering, etc.

## Armor

reduces damage by 1-3, but slows you down. Medium armor puts all athletics rolls on disadvantage, so roll 2 D20, choose the worst. (except when you gain an advantage, that cancels disadvantage out.) Heavy armor gives disadvantage to both athletics and  sneaking.

| Armor                   | **Disadvantage**                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light, reduce 1 damage  | Move -1                                                     |
| Medium, reduce 2 damage | Athletics, move * is average of light and heavy move speed. |
| Heavy, reduce 3 damage  | Sneaking, move / 2                                          |

# [Critical tables](Critical tables.md)
- piercing
- slashing
- bludgeoning

Critical tables, when you roll natural 20
- Wild magic tables for natural 20 and natural 1, 
- also magicians roll wild magic when they simply fail difficulty roll.

## Combat, Actions
### ACTION ONLY: 
Sometimes, you’re exactly where you want to be and staying put for this TURN. You might... 
• Attack an enemy with a weapon 
• Take a closer look at encoded glyphs or symbols 
• Call upon magic power to cast a SPELL 

### MOVE NEAR + ACTION: 
Usually, you’ll need to move just a bit to get where you’re needed, then make a roll to do something. You might... 
• Dash down a corridor and smash a hole in the wall 
• Hurry to a friend and heal her injuries 
• Move through a battlefield to block incoming arrows 
• move your move number in meters

### MOVE FAR: 
Use your entire TURN just to move twice as far as normal. If you just need to move as far as you can, you might...

### WHEN YOU REACH 0 HP
 As you take damage in the bone-crunching worlds of ICRPG, you’ll eventually f ind yourself at 0. At that instant, your character drops unconscious. All SPELLS or effects you were creating vanish, and you’re bleeding out fast. The clock is t icking on your life. 
###  ROLL FOR DYING!
  On your NEXT TURN after you drop to 0 HP, roll a D20. Pray you roll high, because in success number of ROUNDS, without help or a MIRACLE, your character will die with a capital D.

###     IT’S A MIRACLE! 
    On each of your TURNS while you’re DYING, you get a very narrow chance to miraculously regain consciousness. Roll a D20. If it’s a natural 20, some miracle of anatomy has brought you back awake with 1 HP. It’s a MIRACLE!

# Dungeon delving
##  turns:
While dungeon delving, time is tracked in 10-minute segments called turns. Most actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take up one turn.

## crawling speed: 
40mper turn. PCs spend most of this time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. At this speed, the PCs automatically detect traps and map their environment.

## walking speed: 
800m per turn. PCs are surprised by all encounters and spring all traps, but may still map the dungeon. Walking speed is usually used when backtracking through areas the party has already explored. 

## running speed: 
1600m per turn. PCs are surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. Candles are blown out. 

Running speed is typically used as a last resort, usually when the party is fleeing for their lives.
